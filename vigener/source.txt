One hundred and ninety-one floors up, you look over the edge of the roof and the street
below is mottled with a shag carpet of people, standing, looking up. The breaking glass is a
window right below us. A window blows out the side of the building, and then comes a file
cabinet big as a black refrigerator, right below us a six-drawer filing cabinet drops right out of
the cliff face of the building, and drops turning slowly, and drops getting smaller, and drops
disappearing into the packed crowd.
Somewhere in the one hundred and ninety-one floors under us, the space monkeys in the
Mischief Committee of Project Mayhem are running wild, destroying every scrap of history.
That old saying, how you always kill the one you love, well, look, it works both ways.
With a gun stuck in your mouth and the barrel of the gun between your teeth, you can only
talk in vowels.
We're down to our last ten minutes.
Another window blows out of the building, and glass sprays out, sparkling flock-of-pigeons
style, and then a dark wooden desk pushed by the Mischief Committee emerges inch by inch
from the side of the building until the desk tilts and slides and turns end-over-end into a
magic flying thing lost in the crowd.
